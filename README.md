# ShootingSquares
Project shows my game development learning process.

It's work in progress project.

In febuary 2017 I decided that it's time to create my first game. 
The idea was to learn more about game development, c++ and programming techniques.

I wanted to create a game, in which I could play with friends, so it's a simple 
one-screen multiplayer shooting game. 
I tried to create shooting in all directions with keyboard input, but after testing it, I figured out 
that controller will handle aiming better, yet by doing so I removed the possibility to move or shoot by keyboard.

Controls:

It's impossible to shoot without aiming, because I want to add an option 
to protect against incoming damage by using the same aiming input and different key 
to create a partial force field (probably right trigger), so that the player won't be allowed 
to shoot and defend at the same time.

xbox controller: 
movement - left analog stick 
aiming - right analog stick 
shooting - left trigger 
exit game - B

debug mouse contol for first player only: 
left mouse button anywhere to enable debug movement, then clicking left mouse button allows to shoot in one direction 
movement - mouse position
exit game - right mouse button
